# LED-dress

- Brief

I'm always crazy about beautiful dresses and glittering things. Thus I want to combine them together.
This is a dress on which the LEDs blink in different colors or patterns according to the wearer's movement.
I look forward to dancing in it.

- Technology

Use a gyroscope sensor or acceleration sensor to detect the movement of the wearer.
